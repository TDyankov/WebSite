			<h2>Content and reasoning</h2>
			<p>While working on the site I found out that I often put a side notes about what I tried, did I liked and am I going to use it and what is it useful for. 
			All of this is neither exciting or creative but I found this notes useful durring the process. 
			It may be that my memore doesn't serve that well anymore but I keep reading them while creating a new page so I thought it may be useful if I share it with the comunity.
			I will appritiate any comments or suggestions and feeel free to use anything that I post here for any usage you may find. </p>
